                            As CushyRental strives to provide real-time
                            information and updates to users, the system is
                            requiring its users especially registered landlords
                            to keep their accounts active. Renters availing unit
                            will only last for 24 hours, after a day without
                            confirmation to the request, the request will
                            automatically cancel. This measure is necessary to
                            prevent lengthier waiting times for boarding home
                            finders and to guarantee that the platform will
